Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he hath been proved, he shall receive a crown of life, which God hath promised to them that love him.
Let no man, when he is tempted, say that he is tempted by God. For God is not a tempter of evils, and he tempteth no man.
But every man is tempted by his own concupiscence, being drawn away and allured.
Then when concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin. But sin, when it is completed, begetteth death.
