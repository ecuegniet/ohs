We believe in God, believe also in Him Who is by nature and not by robbery equal with God, for in that He emptied Himself, He did it not by laying aside the form of God, but by taking upon Him the form of a servant. Ye fear death for this form of a servant, but let not your heart be troubled, the form of God will raise it up again. But what signifieth that which followeth: “In My Father’s house there are many mansions.” Was it not that they had fear on their own account, and needed for themselves to hear Him say, “Let not your heart be troubled” Which of them trembled not when they had heard Him say to Peter, the lealest and boldest of them all: “The cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest Me.”
