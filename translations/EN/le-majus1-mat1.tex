Lesson from the letter of St. James the Apostle.
James the servant of God, and of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.
My brethren, count it all joy, when you shall fall into diverse temptations;
Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience.
And patience hath a perfect work; that you may be perfect and entire, failing in nothing.
But if any of you want wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men abundantly, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.
