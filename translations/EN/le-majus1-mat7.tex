From the Holy Gospel according to John.
At that time, Jesus said unto His disciples: “Let not your heart be troubled. Ye believe in God, believe also in Me. In My Father’s house there are many mansions.” And so on.

Homily by St. Augustine, Bishop of Hippo.
It behoveth us, my brethren, to have our minds more given toward God, if we would that those words of the Holy Gospel which have just sounded in our ears, should become a living reality for our understandings. The Lord Jesus saith: “Let not your heart be troubled. Ye believe in God, believe also in Me.” Lest, being but men, their heart should be troubled by the fear of death, He strengtheneth them, even by the reminder that He is God. He saith: “Ye believe in God, believe also in Me”, for if ye believe in God, ye must needs believe in Me. And this were not so, if Christ were not God.
